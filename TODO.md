TODOs
=====

These are things/snippets I want/need to remember, think about or do for
this project.

* Check out Doxygen
* Start using CMake
* Make some shortcuts for long-ass lines (`std::` bullshit)
  * macros? imports?
* Understand how to make own types easier & overuse it (I need to keep
  separate layers of this project 'more abstract' from each other)
